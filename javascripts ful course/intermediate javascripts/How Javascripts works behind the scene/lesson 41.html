<h1><center>An High-level Overwiew of Javascript</center></h1>
<p>JAVASCRIPT IS A <span>HIGH-LEVEL</span>  <span>PROTOTYPE-BASED OBJECT-ORIENTED</span> <span> multi-paradigm</span>
<span>interpreted or just-in-time compiled</span> <span> dynamic</span> <span> single-threaded</span> <span> garbage-collector</span> programming language
with <span> first-class functions</span> and a <span>non-blocking event loop</span> concurrency model</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">The breakdown of the definition</h3>
<dt>
    <dl>1. <span>HIGH-LEVEL</span></dl>
    <dd>Javascript is one of the high-level language, meaning "it's abstracted from the low-level workings of the computer it is running on". Developer does not have to worry coz everything happens automatically.</dd>
</dt>
<dt>
    <dl>2. <span>garbage-collected</span></dl>
    <dd>Javascript is a refer to as garbage-collector because its monitor memory allocation and determine when a block of allocated memory is no longer needed and reclaim it.</dd>
</dt>
<dt>
    <dl>3. <span>interpreted or just-in-time compiled</span></dl>
    <dd>Javascripts is considered as interpreted language, since the compilation is handled at run time, rather than ahead of time.</dd>
    <p><center style="color: #62da4a; font-size: 20px; font-style: italic;">it will be explained later in the course</center></p>
</dt>
<dt>
    <dl>4. <span>multi-paradigm</span></dl>
    <dd>Javascript is considered as multi-paradigm scripting language: which means that it is very dynamic in nature and supports various types of programming styles, such as object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming.</dd>
</dt>
<dt>
    <dl>5. <span>PROTOTYPE-BASED OBJECT-ORIENTED</span> </dl>
    <dd>Javascript is a PROTOTYPE-BASED language: meaning object properties and methods can be shared through generalized objects that have the ability to be cloned and extended.</dd>
    <p><center style="color: #62da4a; font-size: 20px; font-style: italic;">it will be explained later in the course</center></p>
</dt>
<dt>
    <dl>6. <span> first-class functions</span></dl>
    <dd>Javascript is said be a first-class function because if function in that language are treated like other variables,  the functions can be assigned to any other variables or passed as an argument or can be passed as an argument or can be returned by another function.</dd>
</dt>
<dt>
    <dl>7. <span>dynamic</span> </dl>
    <dd>Javascript is said to be dynamic because it does not require explicit declaration of the variables before they are used.</dd>
</dt>
<dt>
    <dl>8. <span>single-threaded</span></dl>
    <dd>Javascript is said to be single-threaded language because it's just one line of code may be run at once. in addition, it was only a web browser scripting language created to serve the needs of a single user on a single window of the browser, eliminating the need for multithreading.</dd>
</dt>
<dt>
    <dl>9. <span>non-blocking event loop</span></dl>
    <dd>Javascript is know to be non-blocking event loop because javascript doesn't wait for the response of an API call, an ajax request, an I/O event or a timer but moves on the the other block of code below it.</dd>
</dt>
